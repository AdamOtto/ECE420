To compile the program, navigate to the project folder and copy/past the mpicc commands into your terminal.
We have two solutions, REF and REF2.  REF contains our initial serialized code and REF2 contains the optimized version of REF.
Once the programs are made, use the mpirun command (also in the makefile) to run the code.
The program will only work if there is a "data_input" and "data_output" file in the project folder.  These can be generated using the datatrim program, its compile code is at the bottom of the makefile.

After the program has run, you can check if the solution is correct using serialtester.  The code to compile this are in the makefile.
